<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Cooling for Data Center Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid cooling for data centers involves using liquid as a heat transfer medium to enhance efficiency and performance. Single-phase cooling circulates a liquid that remains in a single phase, typically water or glycol, which absorbs heat as it passes through equipment. In contrast, two-phase cooling utilizes a refrigerant that vaporizes and condenses to absorb significant amounts of heat, allowing for more effective thermal management. Both methods aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact in data center operations.</p></p>
